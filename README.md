# Overview

[![Gittip](http://img.shields.io/gittip/bkuhlmann.svg)](https://www.gittip.com/bkuhlmann)

Shell scripts for the installation of commonly used Go packages.

Sometimes, when setting up a new machine, there is a need for automating the install of commonly used packages
(i.e. setting up your toolbox). This solves that problem by providing a master list of commonly used packages which
can be installed via a single command.

# Features

Installs the following packages:

- [pup](https://github.com/EricChiang/pup)

# Requirements

- [OSX](https://github.com/bkuhlmann/osx)

# Setup

Open a terminal window and execute one of the following depending on your version preference:

Current Version (stable):

    git clone git://github.com/bkuhlmann/go_setup.git
    cd go_setup
    git checkout v0.1.0

Master Version (unstable):

    git clone git://github.com/bkuhlmann/go_setup.git
    cd go_setup

# Usage

Edit the settings/packages.txt as you see fit. Blank lines and lines that begin with '#' will be ignored.
Then open a terminal window to execute the following command:

    ./run.sh

Running the script will present the following options:

    i: Install packages.
    q: Quit/Exit.

Choose option 'i' to install.

The options prompt can be skipped by passing the desired option directly to the run.sh script.
For example, executing "./run.sh i" will execute the install.
